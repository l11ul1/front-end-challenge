# Shopify Challenge Project:

The project is a showcase of the skills learned during my program and previos co-op terms for the front-end development position in Shopify.
For this project I used react with a typescript. State management is handled by the React Context API.
Most of the components have been implemented using pure html and css to showcase the deep knowledge of html and css usage.
But could be implemented thruogh the different components libraries such.

## Available Scripts:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Application Compatability:

Application has been tested for the full compatabity for the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
