# Shopify Challenge Project:

The project is a showcase of the skills learned during my program and previos co-op terms for the front-end development position at Shopify.
For this project I used react with Typescript. State management is handled by the React Context API but could have been done with Redux as well.
Most of the components have been implemented using pure html and css to showcase the deep knowledge and understanding of core web development tools,
but could be implemented thruogh the different components libraries such as Bootstrap.

## Application Compatability:

Application has been tested for the full compatabity for the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

## Side components used: 

* react-tostify: provide a nice toast message
* fontawesome: provide components for the icons 
* react-elastic-carousel: carousel component
* react-spinners: provide a spinner component

## Available Scripts:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
